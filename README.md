This is an experiment done at the Buschenschank sprint 2024.

Main goals:

- install and configure Plone with `Ansible`.
- do not depend on `zc.buildout` anymore

Test it yourself:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ale-rt/install_plone_with_ansible_experiment.git plone
cd plone
make
make start
```
